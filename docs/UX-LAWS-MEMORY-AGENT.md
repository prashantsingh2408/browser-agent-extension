# Laws of UX Applied to Memory Agent

## Overview
This document details how we've applied UX principles from [lawsofux.com](https://lawsofux.com/) to create an optimal Memory Agent interface.

## üé® Applied UX Laws

### 1. **Aesthetic-Usability Effect**
> Users perceive aesthetically pleasing design as more usable

**Applied:**
- Gradient backgrounds on headers
- Smooth animations on all interactions
- Consistent color scheme
- Beautiful shadows and borders
- Visual hierarchy with spacing

### 2. **Chunking**
> Group individual pieces into meaningful wholes

**Applied:**
- **Capture Section** - Groups screenshot & video
- **Import Section** - Groups docs & images
- Clear section headers with icons
- Visual separation between groups

### 3. **Cognitive Load** 
> Minimize mental resources needed

**Applied:**
- Only 4 main actions visible (not overwhelming)
- Clear labels on every button
- Icons support text labels
- Progressive disclosure (modals for complex options)

### 4. **Doherty Threshold**
> Interactions should be <400ms

**Applied:**
- Instant visual feedback on clicks
- Progress indicators for longer tasks
- Optimistic UI updates
- Cached memory rendering

### 5. **Fitts's Law**
> Important targets should be large and close

**Applied:**
- Large control buttons (100px height)
- Most-used actions at top
- Good spacing between buttons (easy to hit)
- No tiny click targets

### 6. **Goal-Gradient Effect**
> Show progress toward goals

**Applied:**
- Progress bars during capture/upload
- Step-by-step feedback (Capturing ‚Üí AI Caption ‚Üí Saving)
- Memory counter shows growth
- Visual confirmation on completion

### 7. **Hick's Law**
> Fewer choices = faster decisions

**Applied:**
- Only 4 main options (not 10+)
- Two-level hierarchy (sections with 2 buttons each)
- Additional options hidden in modals
- Clear primary actions

### 8. **Jakob's Law**
> Users prefer familiar patterns

**Applied:**
- Standard search bar placement
- Familiar filter pills (like Gmail)
- Modal dialogs for complex actions
- Common icon usage (camera, folder, etc.)

### 9. **Law of Common Region**
> Group elements with boundaries

**Applied:**
- Control sections have visual containers
- White backgrounds separate groups
- Border-bottom creates clear divisions
- Each memory card has clear boundaries

### 10. **Law of Proximity**
> Near items are perceived as related

**Applied:**
- Screenshot + Video grouped together (both capture)
- Docs + Images grouped together (both import)
- Icon placed directly above label
- Related info in memory cards stays close

### 11. **Law of Similarity**
> Similar elements perceived as group

**Applied:**
- All control buttons same size/shape
- Consistent icon style throughout
- Matching border-radius
- Unified color palette

### 12. **Miller's Law**
> Keep 7¬±2 items in working memory

**Applied:**
- 4 main control buttons (well under 7)
- 5 filter categories (within limit)
- Section headers reduce cognitive load
- Chunked into 2 sections

### 13. **Peak-End Rule**
> Users remember peak and end experiences

**Applied:**
- Success animations at completion (‚úÖ)
- Positive feedback messages
- Smooth closing animations
- Celebratory toast notifications

### 14. **Serial Position Effect**
> First and last items remembered best

**Applied:**
- Most important (Screenshot) placed first
- Search bar prominent after controls
- "Add Memory" button at top-right
- Critical actions in primary positions

### 15. **Von Restorff Effect**
> Distinctive items are remembered

**Applied:**
- Live counter badge stands out
- Pulsing recording indicator
- Color-coded sections (blue, green, pink)
- Different hover colors for each button

### 16. **Paradox of the Active User**
> Users don't read manuals, they act immediately

**Applied:**
- Self-explanatory buttons (icon + text)
- Tooltips on hover
- Immediate feedback on click
- No setup required to start

### 17. **Postel's Law**
> Liberal in what you accept

**Applied:**
- Accepts multiple image formats
- Works with/without Chrome AI
- Graceful fallbacks everywhere
- Flexible input handling

### 18. **Selective Attention**
> Users focus on goal-related stimuli

**Applied:**
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Important actions highlighted
- Subtle secondary actions
- Context-aware suggestions

## üìê Design Decisions Based on UX Laws

### Button Layout (2x2 Grid)
**Laws Applied:** Miller's Law, Fitts's Law, Chunking
- 4 buttons total (manageable)
- Large click targets (100px)
- Grouped by purpose

### Section Headers
**Laws Applied:** Chunking, Law of Common Region
- "CAPTURE" and "IMPORT" clearly labeled
- Icons reinforce meaning
- Uppercase for emphasis

### Live Feedback System
**Laws Applied:** Doherty Threshold, Goal-Gradient Effect
- Progress bars show advancement
- Status text updates in real-time
- < 400ms response on clicks
- Clear completion states

### Memory Counter
**Laws Applied:** Peak-End Rule, Von Restorff Effect
- Always visible
- Updates with animation
- Stands out visually
- Positive reinforcement

### Color Coding
**Laws Applied:** Law of Similarity, Von Restorff Effect
- Blue for screenshots (standard)
- Pink for video (energetic)
