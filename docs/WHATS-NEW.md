5. **Context-Aware** - Remembers where and when you saved things

## Current Limitations & Future

## Need Help?

### Common Issues

**Q: Screenshot button not working?**
A: Make sure you've granted the extension permissions to access tabs.

**Q: AI caption not generating?**
A: Chrome AI might not be available. Check `chrome://flags` for "Prompt API for Gemini Nano"

**Q: Suggestions panel empty?**
A: Create more memories first! Suggestions work better with more data.

**Q: Semantic search not working?**
A: Falls back to text search automatically if Chrome AI unavailable.
