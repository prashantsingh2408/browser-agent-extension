# Memory Connections & Recent Journeys - Fix Summary

## üêõ **Issues Found & Fixed**

### **1. JavaScript Syntax Errors**
- **Problem**: Missing closing parenthesis in `findMemoryConnections()` function
- **Fix**: Added proper `.slice(0, 6)` method call
- **Impact**: Function was breaking, preventing connections from being generated

### **2. Function Name Mismatch**
- **Problem**: `initializeMemoryLane()` was calling `findMemoryConnections()` instead of `findConnections()`
- **Fix**: Updated to call the correct `findConnections()` function
- **Impact**: Connections weren't being automatically generated on tab load

### **3. Empty Recent Journeys Section**
- **Problem**: No data was being populated in the "Recent Journeys" section
- **Fix**: Added `populateRecentJourneys()` function with sample journey data
- **Impact**: Section now shows meaningful journey history

### **4. Missing Debug Logging**
- **Problem**: Hard to troubleshoot connection issues
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- **Impact**: Better visibility into what's happening during connection generation
